# grim-dawn-component-calculator
Calculates optimum components for maximizing resistances in [Grim Dawn](https://grimdawn.com).

This tool was created to help overcome what was, for me, the worst part of leveling up a character in Grim Dawn: figuring out what components to use. It was especially painful whenever I reached a certain level that allowed me to completely replace my equipment, changing all my resistances and forcing me to spend several minutes analyzing all the different possibilities of components in order to find the optimal configuration (because if I didn't do that, the game became way more difficult).

With this tool, all you have to do is input the information of your character:

1. Character level
2. Template (weapon+shield, weapon+offhand, 2-hand weapon)
3. Current resistances
4. Which slots are not available to receive components

Then you click the **Calculate Optimal Components** buttons and it will tell you which components you have to use in which slots for maximum possible resistances in your character. It's as simple as that.

The results will be saved on your local computer, so if you refresh the page or come back at it later it will remember your options and the results of your previous calculations.
